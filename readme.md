# Spring PetClinic Sample Application 

Same as original with a generation of a pdf file.

This demonstrates how to integrate the [Apache PDFBox](https://pdfbox.apache.org/) library.
If you start the app and browse to the owner detail, you will have an additional button that lets you export the owner information in pdf.

This samples heavily rely on PDFBox as well as [pdfbox-layout](https://github.com/ralfstuckert/pdfbox-layout).
